### Introduction

The problem that our group set out to solve with this project was manifested by the booming success of the audio streaming industry, where a seemingly countless number of independent music artists and podcasters have been able to kickstart their careers by publishing their work independently on platforms such as Spotify and Soundcloud. As the industry has grown, a significant challenge has emerged: the high barriers to entering audio production. These obstacles include the steep learning curve of traditional audio editing software, hefty download requirements, high costs, and the extensive music theory knowledge aspiring musicians need to succeed in the field.

To provide a solution to this problem, Mellowdies combines AI generation with traditional music editing tools to service both newcomers and veteran music producers from the comforts of their browsers. Digital audio workstation (DAW) applications like Bandlab and Descript have made strides by offering a browser-based audio editor and an AI-powered audio generator, respectively. However, these solutions often come with drawbacks such as a steep learning curve, financial costs, or a lack of seamless integration with essential tools like AI within the same platform. Mellowdies serves as a comprehensive digital audio workstation that builds upon previous DAWs by integrating their best features (various audio editing tools and AI music generation) into a free web application that can be easily accessed and utilized to create quality music, regardless of how skilled or experienced the user is at editing and manipulating audio. Our team is confident that a solution that builds upon the innovations of previous audio editing breakthroughs while circumventing the stopgaps associated with modern editing software will allow the audio streaming industry to get over the “barrier to entry” problem.
