How to run:

Open a terminal and navigate to project directory
Type "Node proxy-server.js" to run proxy server. This is to send requests from backend proxy, as front end calls are blocked
In a different terminal, navigate to project directory and run "npm start"
Upload a file or not in localhost:3000 that opens
Click the AI suggestion button
Notice the log: An API request is being sent and there is a response...
Will need to work beyond this of course, but its a start
